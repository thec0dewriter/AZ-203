Before that let us have a look at the Campaign table.\r\n    select  Top 100 * from wwi_Security.Sale\r\n    where City is not null and state is not null\r\n\r\n    /*  Consider a scenario where there are two users.\r\n        A CEO, who is an authorized  personnel with access to all the information in the database\r\n        and a Data Analyst, to whom only required information should be presented.*/\r\n\r\n    -- Step:2 Verify the existence of the 'CEO' and 'DataAnalystMiami' users in the Datawarehouse.\r\n    SELECT Name as [User1] FROM sys.sysusers WHERE name = N'CEO';\r\n    SELECT Name as [User2] FROM sys.sysusers WHERE name = N'DataAnalystMiami';\r\n\r\n\r\n    -- Step:3 Now let us enforce column level security for the DataAnalystMiami.\r\n    /*  The Sales table in the warehouse has information like ProductID, Analyst, Product, CampaignName, Quantity, Region, State, City, RevenueTarget and Revenue.\r\n        The Revenue generated from every campaign is classified and should be hidden from DataAnalystMiami.\r\n    */\r\n\r\n    REVOKE SELECT ON wwi_security.Sale FROM DataAnalystMiami;\r\n    GRANT SELECT ON wwi_security.Sale([ProductID], [Analyst], [Product], [CampaignName],[Quantity], [Region], [State], [City], [RevenueTarget]) TO DataAnalystMiami;\r\n    -- This provides DataAnalystMiami access to all the columns of the Sale table but Revenue.\r\n\r\n    -- Step:4 Then, to check if the security has been enforced, we execute the following query with current User As 'DataAnalystMiami', this will result in an error\r\n    --  since DataAnalystMiami doesn't have select access to the Revenue column\r\n    EXECUTE AS USER ='DataAnalystMiami';\r\n    select TOP 100 * from wwi_security.Sale;\r\n    ---\r\n    -- The following query will succeed since we are not including the Revenue column in the query.\r\n    EXECUTE AS USER ='DataAnalystMiami';\r\n    select [ProductID], [Analyst], [Product], [CampaignName],[Quantity], [Region], [State], [City], [RevenueTarget] from wwi_security.Sale;\r\n    \r\n    -- Step:5 Whereas, the CEO of the company should be authorized with all the information present in the warehouse.To do so, we execute the following query.\r\n    Revert;\r\n    GRANT SELECT ON wwi_security.Sale TO CEO;  --Full access to all columns.\r\n\r\n    -- Step:6 Let us check if our CEO user can see all the information that is present.
